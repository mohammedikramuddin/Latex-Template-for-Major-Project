 Three-operand binary adder is the basic functional unit to perform the modular arithmetic in various cryptography and pseudorandom bit generator (PRBG) algorithms. Carry save adder (CS3A) is the widely used technique to perform the three-operand addition. However, the ripple-carry stage in the CS3A leads to a high propagation delay of O(n). Moreover, a parallel prefix two-operand adder such as Han-Carlson (HCA) can also be used for three-operand addition that significantly reduces the critical path delay at the cost of additional hardware. Hence, a new high-speed and area-efficient adder architecture is proposed using pre-compute bitwise addition followed by carry prefix computation logic to perform the three-operand binary addition that consumes substantially less area, low power and drastically reduces the adder delay to O($ log_{2}n $). \par





A 16x16 Vedic Multiplier is designed using Carry Save Adder and High-Speed Area Efficient Adder and both the multipliers are implemented and simulated using Verilog code in Xilinx Vivado ISE. The delay and power consumption are measured for both the multipliers.
