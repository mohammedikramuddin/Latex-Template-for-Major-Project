\chapter{Conclusion and Future Scope}

\section{Conclusion}
Multiplication is a resource hungry operation and is a major computational need in complex circuits. Through literature survey, it was found that As multipliers play a critical role in any digital design. It is necessary to implement faster multipliers occupying lesser area and consuming less power. Multiplication operation can be done using Array multiplier, redundant binary structures and tree structures but they have problem of larger delay. Vedic Multipliers are faster compared to traditional Array multiplier, Wallace tree multiplier etc.\\
The 16x16 Vedic Multiplier using High-speed-area-efficient adder is having the power consumption and total delay of 55ÂµW and 824ps respectively which is much better as compared to 16x16 Vedic Multiplier using CSA.


\section{Future Scope}
Further work can be taken up to increase bit-length and improve accuracy. Also, this modified Vedic Multiplier can be tested on different dataset or can be explored for different application.
